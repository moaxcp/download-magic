This project aims to create a DownloadManager that can interact with a database to do various jobs.

Currently there are no tasks to query or update a database but there will be soon. I am working on the DownloadTask and GUI. The top priority is to make sure at the end of each download all the information requested for that download is generated.

Each top folder in the trunk folder is a NetBeans project. It should be really easy to get started. If you need the libraries for the projects they are included in the current project-penny.zip file. You will probably need to resolve the libraries using these files.

This project is named after my dog Penny!
