The DownloadManagerTestSite is a webapp that can be used to test the DownloadManager with http and generate urls for http and ftp.

To setup the project put downloads into the download folder and and run the webapp. Open index.jsp. This will list both http and ftp urls in two sections.

The first section is urls whose file is smaller than 500k. The second section is urls that are larger than 500k.

To setup ftp install an ftp server. I used proftpd. Anonymous access must be allowed. Add the same files that are in the downloads folder in the webapp to DownloadManagerTestSite/downloads in the ftp server.

You can edit the index.jsp to match your setup.

Example urls:
http://localhost:8084/DownloadManagerTestSite/downloads/OldJohnMercier/LOG.TXT
ftp://anonymous@localhost/DownloadManagerTestSite/downloads/OldJohnMercier/LOG.TXT

Now you can save the two lists into a file and add them to DownloadManager through the add button.
